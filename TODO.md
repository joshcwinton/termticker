- (DONE) Add functions for other data queries (especially intraday).
- (DONE) Add ability to just say today for the date (or last available).
- (DONE) Split out functions from main
- Better date handling (only works for exact dates for monthly and weekly right now)
     - Also make a way to search just the first part of the date for monthly (might actually avoid part of this issue by splitting up the request for the date so I dont force the user to format the date)
     - Kind of similar idea for time since this api doesn't handle seconds anyway 
- Better error handling
- Add a way to find closest date
- Maybe write a python version so I can make graphs 
- Might calculate things like day change and avg daily price
